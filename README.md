# Working

## Step 1:
 Clone this repo and install requirements (fastAPI and uvicorn) from requirements.txt
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Step 2:
Start server by uvicorn
`uvicorn main:app`

**The Developmental server will run on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ by default and API will be served at root**
